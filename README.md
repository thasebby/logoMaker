# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to create different objects and use them across different files to create an SVG image. It also taught me how to create a test file to check that everything is working out before being deployed. 


## Installation

Have to run an 'npm i' in order to install inquirer to be able to ask different questions as well as installing 'jest' in order to run the necessary tests.

## Usage

The program will provide four different questions that will allow the user to choose the text, text color, shape and the shape color for the 'logo.svg' file that is going to be produced.

## Credits

Used the MDN web docs to figure out how to set up the different shapes being displayed.
